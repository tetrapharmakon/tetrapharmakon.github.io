[[PDF]](stuff/gedi.pdf) My first love is <b>Mathematical Physics</b>, I cannot hide it. In writing these poor and chaotic pages I wanted to give myself some sort of <i>glossa</i> about basic mathematical methods used in Physics; in fact there's neither something original, nor something new in them, and I should have hidden them to your eyes if I had wanted to avoid a bad impression. But I definitely fell in love with Wheeler's idea that "Physics is [a part of] Geometry", and I'm fascinated by the ill genius of <a href="http://wiki.devicerandom.org/Anatolij_Fomenko">A. Fomenko</a>, so I can't quit my quixotic quest for a rigorous foundation of Mathematical Physics...
