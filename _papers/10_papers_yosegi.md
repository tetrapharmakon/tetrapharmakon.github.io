[arXiv:1901.01594](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01594) •
We prove an equivalence between cocomplete Yoneda structures and certain proarrow equipments on a 2-category K. In order to do this, we recognize the presheaf construction of a cocomplete Yoneda structure as a relative, lax idempotent monad sending each admissible 1-cell to an adjunction. Each cocomplete Yoneda structure on K arises in this way from a relative lax idempotent monad "with enough adjoint 1-cells", whose domain generates the ideal of admissibles, and the Kleisli category of such a monad equips its domain with proarrows. We call these structures "yosegi". Quite often, the presheaf construction associated to a yosegi generates an ambidextrous Yoneda structure; in such a setting there exists a fully formal version of Isbell duality.
