title: Categorical Groups

[[PDF]](stuff/repbeamer.pdf) Categorical groups (or "strict 2-groups") arise, like many other notions, as a categorification. They appear in a number of forms: as "fully dualizable" strict monoidal categories, internal categories in $\mathbf{Grp}$, internal groups in $\mathbf{Cat}$, crossed modules, strict 2-groupoids with a single object...<br>&nbsp; This variety of incarnations gives a very rich theory which can be built by the power of analogy with the  set-theoretic case: my exposition will concentrate mostly on two sides of the story:

1. [0407463][mackaay] As set-theoretic groups can be linearly represented on vectors spaces, so 2-groups can be 2-linearly represented on 2-vector spaces, thanks to a construction by Voevodsky and Kapranov; the category 2-$\mathbf{Vect}$ carries an astoundingly rich structure, and so does the category of representations Fun($\mathbf{G}$, 2-$\mathbf{Vect}$).
2. [0801.3843][baez] As (suitably tame) topological groups give Cech theory of principal G-bundles, so 2-groups give Cech theory of principal 2-bundles; Cech cocycles can be characterized, thanks to an idea by G. Segal, as suitable functors, allowing to recover a categorified Cech theory of "2-bundles".
