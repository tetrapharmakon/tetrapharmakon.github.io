title: Homotopical Algebra for $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras
subtitle:
---

[[PDF]](stuff/model2.pdf) Homotopical Algebra showed to be extremely fruitful in studying categories of
"things that resemble spaces" and structured spaces, keeping track of their structure in the
step-by-step construction of abstract homotopy invariants; so in a certain sense it is natural
to apply this complicated machinery to the category $\mathrm{C}^\ast\text{-}\mathbf{Alg}$: all in all, Gel'fand-Naimark's theorem tells that there exists an equivalence $$\mathrm{C}^\ast\text{-}\mathbf{Alg}\cong \mathbf{LCHaus}.$$

&nbsp; Starting from this we shouldn't be surprised by the existence of homotopical methods in $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra theory, and it should be natural to spend a considerable effort to endow $\mathrm{C}^\ast\text{-}\mathbf{Alg}$ with a model structure, maybe exploiting one of the various pre-existing model structures on $\mathbf{Top}$: this is (almost) what [Uuye] proposed in his article.

&nbsp; The main problem is that the category of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras admits a homotopical calculus which can't be extended to a full model structure in the sense of [Quillen]. This is precisely Theorem 5.2, which we take from [Uuye], who repeats an unpublished argument by Andersen and Grodal; the plan to overcome this difficulty is to seek for a weaker form of Homotopical Calculus, still fitting our needs. To this end, the main reference is [Brown]'s thesis, which laid the foundations of this weaker abstract Homotopy Theory, based on the notion of "category with fibrant objects". Instead of looking for a full model structure on $\mathrm{C}^\ast\text{-}\mathbf{Alg}$ we seek for a fibrant one, exploiting the track drawn by [Uuye]'s paper, which is the main reference of the talk together with [Brown]'s thesis.
