Classical AQFT can be defined as a cosheaf $\mathcal{A}$ of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras on the manifold of space-time (or more generally, on a suitable lorentzian manifold playing such rôle) <i>M</i>, satisfying two axioms: <b>locality</b>, ensuring that observables in an open region are <i>a fortiori</i> observables in any superset of that region, and <b>causality</b>, ensuring that If 	$U,V$ are spacelike separated regions, then $\mathcal A(U)$ and $\mathcal A(V)$ pairwise commute as subalgebras of $\mathcal A(M)$.<br>

&nbsp; Now what if we want to suitably <i>categorify</i> this notion, extending it to the realm of tensor  categories (that is, categories equipped with a tensor functor subject to suitable axioms)? Causality has  to be replaced by a higher-categorical analogue of the concept of commutators of a subalgebra of $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb H)$ and Von Neumann algebras, leading to the definition of a <i>Von Neumann category</i> as a subcategory of $\mathbf{Hilb}_{\mathbb H}$ which equals its double commutant.
