Our name is a pun between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant">Jacobian</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobin">Jacobins</a>; it is intended to be some kind of <i>open window</i> towards the scientific attitude to knowledge. We talk about Maths, also developing its interconnection with culture and Philosophy.

I gave seven lectures until now (but three more people talked about Game Theory, Fourier analysis, and analytical solutions to PDEs):

1. [[PDF]](stuff/giaco2_hopf_FIX.pdf) Fibrations between spheres and Hopf theorem
1. [[PDF]](stuff/cats.pdf) The importance of being abstract aka
	A gentle introduction to the categorical point of view to reality;
1. [[PDF]](stuff/tqft_beamer.pdf) low dimensional Topological Quantum Field Theories;
1. [[PDF]](stuff/giaco_complessa2.pdf) Chatting about complex geometry (from symplectic to Kahler manifolds);
1. [[PDF]](stuff/giaco_fibri2.pdf) Connections and Fiber Bundles, with a glance to the geometry of Classical Field Theory;
1. [[PDF]](stuff/chomp.pdf): A short lecure about Computational Homological Algebra, my first piece of (!) applied Mathematics.
1. [[PDF]](stuff/rosetta.pdf) [indeed, yet to come]: Monoidal Categories for the working physicist, a tentative introduction to Categorical approach to Quantum Mechanics.
