title: Homotopical interpretation of stack theory
subtitle:
---

[[PDF]](stuff/stacks2.pdf) In their paper "<em>[Strong stacks and classifying spaces][joyal]</em>" A. Joyal and M. Tierney provide an ​internal characterization of the classical (or ''folk'') model structure on the category of groupoids in a Grothendieck topos <i>E</i>. The fibrant objects in the classical model structure on $\mathbf{Gpd}(\mathcal{E})$ are called ''strong stacks'', as they appear as a strengthening of the notion of stack in $\mathcal{E}$ (i.e. an internal  groupoid object in $\mathcal{E}$ subject to a certain condition which involves ''descent data''). The main application is when $\mathcal{E}$ is the topos of simplicial sheaves on a space or on a site: in that case then strong stacks are intimately connected with classifying space​s of simplicial groups.

&nbsp; Adapting the presentation to the audience needed a ''gentle introduction'' to Topos Theory and the internalization philosophy of Category Theory, and a more neat presentation of the folk model structure on $\mathbf{Gpd}(\mathbf{Set})$ (not to mention the original article by Joyal and Tierney was <em>utterly</em> hard-to-read, so I tried to fill some holes and unraveled some prerequisites).
