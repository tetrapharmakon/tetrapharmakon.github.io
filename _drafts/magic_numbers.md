# Magic numbers

A leitmotiv of mathematics is generalization, often declined as the habit of expressing results making them free or independent of arbitrary choices. When achieved, the outcomes vary greatly: from trivial to profound and from intuitive to disturbing. Here I gather some example from the sinister tail of the spectrum.

One must always be cautious: an unexpected answer may be either profound or the result of a poor question.

## Algebra

### Linear algebra

#### Cross products

### Group theory

#### Automorphisms of $S_n$

[Stub]. $\mathrm{Aut}(S_n)$ are all internal automorphisms, except for $n=6$ where only $720$ in $1440$ are.

## Geometry
