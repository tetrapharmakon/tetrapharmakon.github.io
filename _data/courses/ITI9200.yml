exercises:
  exam: |
    Through the course (more or less every other week) I will publish a document with 3-4 exercises; you have until the next sheet to solve them. They are part of you final grade.
    - Sheet 1 [PDF](stuff/iti9200/sheet_01.pdf) (Deadline: TBA)
    - Sheet 2 [PDF](stuff/iti9200/sheet_02.pdf) (Deadline: TBA)

  mind: |
    - TBA

grading: |
  The grade will be assigned based on exercise sheets assigned during the course, and a final oral exam. 
  
  For the final exam, you can choose a topic from a list, and give a (~30 min+questions) presentation about it. It can relate category theory to whatever you like.

urgent: |
  Urgent announcements for the class will appear here.
