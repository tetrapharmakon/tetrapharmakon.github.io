exercises:
  exam: |
    Through the course (more or less every other week) I will publish a document with 3-4 exercises; you have until the next sheet to solve them. They are part of you final grade.
    - Sheet 1 [PDF](stuff/iti9200/sheet_01.pdf) (Deadline: TBA)
    - Sheet 2 [PDF](stuff/iti9200/sheet_02.pdf) (Deadline: TBA)
    - Sheet 3 [PDF](stuff/iti9200/sheet_03.pdf) (Deadline: TBA)
    - Sheet 4 [PDF](stuff/iti9200/sheet_04.pdf) (Deadline: TBA)
    - Sheet 5 [PDF](stuff/iti9200/sheet_05.pdf) (Deadline: TBA)
  mind: |
    - [Spiritual exercises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_Exercises) ([link](https://tetrapharmakon.github.io/stuff/iti9200/conceptual_napkin.pdf)). 
    
    <b>Warning</b>: this set of exercises is not meant as part of the course, its content is extremely volatile in some parts, and it is usually addressed to people who already have a decent mathematical exposition. 
    
    The chapter may cause serious damage to the unwary and/or unprepared reader (implying such damage has not already been caused by the lectures...).

grading: |
  Your final grade will be determined based on how well you perform on the exercise sheets handed through the course, and a final oral exam. No one stops you from using a robot to learn; [embrace the future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aMvLtBvKAQ). But: we are going to have a problem if you come at the whiteboard clueless on how to solve the exercises "you" did.
  
  For the final exam, you can choose a topic from a list, and give a (~30 min+questions) presentation about it. It can relate category theory to whatever you like (one year the link was "monads in functional programming" + [supercollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), I dare you to do something cooler than that).

urgent: |
  Urgent announcements for the class will appear here. For example:
  - ⚠️ Attendance will be taken telepathically. Please think loudly.
  - ⚠️ The syllabus has achieved sentience. It knows when you haven't read it.
  - ⚠️ Homework is due yesterday. Late submissions not allowed.
  - ⚠️ Yes, this announcement is on the test. No, you won't know which part.
  - ⚠️ Coffee is not provided. Regret is.
  - ⚠️ If you find a typo, congratulations—you've unlocked a side quest.
  - ⚠️ This message will self-destruct after grading.
