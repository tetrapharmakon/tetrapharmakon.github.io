- title: The Theory of Combinatorial Species
  description: The theory of combinatorial species applies category theory to enumerative combinatorics through the study of the category of functors $\mathbf{Bij}\to\mathbf{Set}$, where $\mathbf{Bij}$ is the category of bijections between finite sets. It's a flourishing area with connections to algebra, topology, logic, computer science and pure category theory.

- title: Coalgebraic Techniques
  description: Coalgebras for endofunctors are a category-theoretic tool to describe state-based systems and their behaviour. The category of coalgebras for a functor $F \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ is the category of pairs $(X, \alpha)$ where $X$ is an object and $\alpha\colon X \to FX$ is a morphism.

- title: Factorization Systems in Algebra and Geometry
  description: A category $\mathcal{C}$ is equipped with a factorization system if there's a way to decompose every morphism of $\mathcal{C}$ as composition of morphisms in classes that are, in a suitable sense, orthogonal. For example, every function $f \colon X\to Y$ between sets can be factored as an epimorphism, followed by a monomorphism. Such an extremely general notion pervades mathematics in its entirety.

- title: Linear and Set-Theoretic Operads
  description: Operads are a foundational tool to capture the notion of structure; introduced by Peter May in algebraic topology, they rapidly found their way as a general tool to talk about operations and representation, and nowadays they find application in algebra, logic, computer science, mathematical physics, representation theory, combinatorics, and more. The theory of operads is a vast field, and this project can focus on the already vast area of linear operad theory (where all objects involved are vector spaces).

- title: Yoneda Structures
  description: Formal category theory attempts to outline the properties of a 2-category that make it behave like the "concrete" 2-category of categories, functors, and natural transformations; much like category theory tries to unravel the formal content of mathematics, <em>formal</em> category theory tries to unravel the formal content <em>of category theory</em>. A Yoneda structure on a 2-category $\mathcal K$ allows to reason with an internal Yoneda lemma, and derive the theorems of category theory as a consequence. This project aims at providing an introduction to YS unifying a body of scattered references and results.

- title: Coend Calculus in Indexed Category Theory
  description: It should be possible to develop <a href="">coend calculus</a> inside the language of indexed category theory. To my knowledge, no one attempted to do this; partly, I believe because this is an exercise in style, but having at our disposal coend calculi for other flavours of formal category theory, I find it a worthy project. What makes this project a bit different from the others is that the question is rather open-ended; the student will have to figure out in what sense the general claim is true.

- title: Grothendieck Derivators
  description: Derivators arose in the late work of A. Grothendieck to address the many shortcomings of triangulated categories; instead of considering just one derived category $\mathbf{D}(\mathcal A)$ attached to an abelian category, one can consider the pseudofunctor $J\mapsto \mathbf{D}(\mathcal A^J)$, and more in general <em>any</em> pseudofunctor of type $\mathbf{Cat}^\text{op} \to \mathbf{CAT}$. This theory expresses all facts about derived categories, in a neat, functorial way, avoiding the drawbacks of focusing on the "base" category $\mathbf{D}(1)$ alone.

- title: Bisimulation and Homotopy Theory
  description: I have thought for quite a bit of time already that "bisimulation" in logic and CS is a relation on transition systems / automata that resembles a lot a notion of homotopy equivalence in abstract homotopy theory. This project aims at exploring this connection, and possibly developing a theory of bisimulation in the style of homotopy theory. I consider this a difficult project to tackle, especially for a Master's thesis, as it's very open-ended and requires a lot of background reading.

- title: The Theory of Model 2-Categories
  description: Some 2-categories have the property that each hom-category $\mathbf{Hom}(X,Y)$ is a model category, and composition $\_\circ\_ \colon \mathbf{Hom}(Y,Z) \times \mathbf{Hom}(X,Y) \to \mathbf{Hom}(X,Z)$ is a left Quillen bifunctor. Examples are abundant and draw from diverse branches of mathematics. What is the general theory of such categories?

- title: Monoidal Topology
  description: Monoidal topology applies techniques of categorical algebra to general topology and order theory. It starts from a (now old) result of Barr characterizing (all!) topological spaces as algebras for a certain monad; monoidal topology regards this result as a particular instance of the fact that "all" metric, topological and order-theoretic structures can be seen as enriched categories.

- title: Shape theory via profunctors
  description: Shape theory is the homotopy theory of pathological spaces, that defines homotopy-invariants like cohomology and homotopy groups for spaces which are not CW complexes. Surprisingly, shape theory is encoded in a branch of 2-category theory. This project would survey on both the algebraic topology and the categorical side of shape theory, and provide a survey of the current state of the art. Such a manuscript would be immensely valuable for the community (and easily publishable), as the current literature is scarce, scattered and sometimes inaccessible.

- title: The Fibration of Wedges and Cowedges
  description: The project started as a spinoff of what my PhD student <a href="https://iwilare.com/">Andrea Laretto</a> has been doing for the last few years; coend calculus turns out to be a promising way to give a semantics for quantifiers of directed type theory. What is the fibrational side of this story? One can cook up a certain bifibration (the "fibration of wedges" of the title), and study its categorical properties. This is somewhat of a hard problem. A prospective goal would be to taxonomize the properties of this fibration, and to provide semantic backup for the syntax developed by Andrea.

- title: Fibrations Associated to Parametric Functors
  description: Every functor $F\colon \mathcal{A}\times \mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{X}$ defines a fibered category "of algebras" $\mathcal A\ltimes_F \mathcal X$ over $\mathcal{A}$, where all $F_A$-algebra structures are considered coherently and compatibly. Such situations should be thought of as generalized instances of semidirect products, hence the notation. Representation theory provides a rich source of examples, as well as categorical logic, topology, geometry. I have plenty of side projects that can be developed in this direction.
