- title: "The Theory of Combinatorial Species"
  description: The theory of combinatorial species applies category theory to enumerative combinatorics through the study of the category of functors $\mathbf{Bij}\to\mathbf{Set}$, where $\mathbf{Bij}$ is the category of bijections between finite sets. It's a flourishing area with connections to algebra, topology, logic, computer science and pure category theory.

- title: "Coalgebraic Techniques"
  description: Coalgebras for endofunctors are a category-theoretic tool to describe state-based systems and their behaviour. The category of coalgebras for a functor $F \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$ is the category of pairs $(X, \alpha)$ where $X$ is an object and $\alpha\colon X \to FX$ is a morphism.

- title: "Factorization Systems in Algebra and Geometry"
  description: A category $\mathcal{C}$ is equipped with a factorization system if there's a way to decompose every morphism of $\mathcal{C}$ as composition of morphisms in classes that are, in a suitable sense, orthogonal. For example, every function $f \colon X\to Y$ between sets can be factored as an epimorphism, followed by a monomorphism. Such an extremely general notion pervades mathematics in its entirety.

- title: "Linear and Set-Theoretic Operads"
  description: Operads are a foundational tool to capture the notion of structure; introduced by Peter May in algebraic topology, they rapidly found their way as a general tool to talk about operations and representation, and nowadays they find application in algebra, logic, computer science, mathematical physics, representation theory, combinatorics, and more. The theory of operads is a vast field, and this project can focus on the already vast area of linear operad theory (where all objects involved are vector spaces).

- title: "Yoneda Structures"
  description: Formal category theory attempts to outline the properties of a 2-category that make it behave like the "concrete" 2-category of categories, functors, and natural transformations; much like category theory tries to unravel the formal content of mathematics, <em>formal</em> category theory tries to unravel the formal content <em>of category theory</em>. A Yoneda structure on a 2-category $\mathcal K$ allows to reason with an internal Yoneda lemma, and derive the theorems of category theory as a consequence. This project aims at providing an introduction to YS unifying a body of scattered references and results.

- title: "Coend Calculus in Indexed Category Theory"
  description: It should be possible to develop <a href="">coend calculus</a> inside the language of indexed category theory. To my knowledge, no one attempted to do this; partly, I believe because this is an exercise in style, but having at our disposal coend calculi for other flavours of formal category theory, I find it a worthy project. What makes this project a bit different from the others is that the question is rather open-ended; the student will have to figure out in what sense the general claim is true.

- title: "Grothendieck Derivators"
  description: Derivators arose in the late work of A. Grothendieck to address the many shortcomings of triangulated categories; instead of considering just one derived category $\mathbf{D}(\mathcal A)$ attached to an abelian category, one can consider the pseudofunctor $J\mapsto \mathbf{D}(\mathcal A^J)$, and more in general <em>any</em> pseudofunctor of type $\mathbf{Cat}^\text{op} \to \mathbf{CAT}$. This theory expresses all facts about derived categories, in a neat, functorial way, avoiding the drawbacks of focusing on the "base" category $\mathbf{D}(1)$ alone.
