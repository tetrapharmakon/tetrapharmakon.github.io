From January to June 2014 I've been a proud member of the [Kan extension seminar][l-Kan]. I [wrote][l-wrote] about Freyd and Kelly's paper "Categories of continuous functors, I", a copy of which you can find [here][l-here]. This experience culminated with the participation to an informal series of short seminars at the [Winstanley	Lecture Theatre][l-Winstanley] in Trinity College, right before the beginning of the [2014	International Category Theory Conference][l-2014].
