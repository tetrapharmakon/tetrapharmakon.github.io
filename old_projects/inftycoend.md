title: Coend calculus in $\infty$-category theory
---

What is co/end calculus in a $\infty$-category, and can one recover all
the nifty descriptions that co/end calculus classically allows
(unification of elementary constructions, descriptions of operads as
monoids for the substitution tensor product, the theory of
profunctors...)?
