title: Transfinite simplicial homotopy
---

Is there a theory (and an homotopy theory) for simplicial $\lambda$-sets
(=presheaves on the category of ordinals smaller than a fixed
$\lambda \ge \omega$)?

My interest in this question is threefold:

-   I've always had this question in my head

-   I need it because I want to describe in a homotopy meaningful way
    the cellularity property of a class of arrows in a $\infty$-category
    $\mathcal C$: morally, composition of edges corresponds to the
    choice of a lifting against a horn-inclusion. But if it is so, then
    "being closed under transfinite composition" must be equivalent to
    being in the class of maps having the RLP against "transfinite horn
    inclusions". More precisely, let $g\in\mathcal{J}$ be an element of
    a cellular class of edges $\mathcal J$ in a $\infty$-category. Then,
    $g$ has the RLP against transfinite horn inclusions
    $\Lambda_\mu^\kappa \subset \Delta^\kappa$.

-   It is related to my question about analytic functors: a main problem
    handling the definition of $[\Delta_{\le \lambda}, \mathbf{Set}]$ is
    that one would like to have "generalized faces and degeneracies" to
    present $\Delta_{\le \lambda}$ as a quotient of a free category.

    The problem is that in $\Delta_{\le \lambda}$ there are no "faces"
    in the sense we hope. The idea is that we have a "simple"
    combinatorial description for $\Delta$ because we have a "simple"
    combinatorics for finite sets. Infinite sets completely lose this
    simplicity.
