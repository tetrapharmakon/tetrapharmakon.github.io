title: Morse theory via factorization systems
---

Is Morse theory the theory of some factorization systems on the category
of cobordisms?

Let $J : \mathbb{R} \to FS(\mathcal{C})$ be a family of factorization
systems indexed by $\mathbb R$. Then, one can define a real number
$\lambda$ to be "$J$-critical" if the $\lambda+\varepsilon$ and
$\lambda -\varepsilon$ factorizations of $f\colon X\to Y$ are both
different from the $\lambda$ factorization.

The idea is: you slice at time $\lambda$, and what you get is different
from what you get before, and from what you get after. In other words,
"the topology of the slice changes". In other words, critical values in
Morse theory.

How many things true in Morse theory can be rewritten in this language?
