[1802.08193](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08193) â€¢ We outline the theory of reflections for prederivators, derivators and stable derivators. In order to parallel the classical theory valid for categories, we outline how reflections can be equivalently described as categories of fractions, reflective factorization systems, and categories of algebras for idempotent monads. This is a further development of the theory of monads and factorization systems for derivators.
