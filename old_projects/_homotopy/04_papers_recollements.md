[1507.03913](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03913) â€¢ This is the third joint work with [D. Fiorenza][df], about $t$-structures in stable $\infty$-categories, which studies recollements. We develop the
theory of recollements in a stable $\infty$-categorical setting. In the axiomatization of Beilinson, Bernstein and Deligne, recollement situations provide a generalization of Grothendieck's "six functors" between derived categories. The adjointness relations between functors in a recollement induce a "recollee" $t$-structure on $\mathcal{D}$, given $t$-structures
$t_0$, $t_1$ on $\mathcal{D}_0$, $\mathcal{D}_1$. Such a classical result, well known in the setting of triangulated categories, acquires a new taste when $t$-structure are described as suitable ($\infty$-categorical) factorization systems: the corresponding factorization system enjoys a number of interesting formal properties and unexpected autodualities. In the geometric case of a stratified space, various recollements arise, which "interact well" with the combinatorics of the intersections of strata to give a well-defined, associative operation. From this we deduce a generalized associative property for $n$-fold gluings, valid in any stable $\infty$-category.
