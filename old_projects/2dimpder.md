title: 2-dimensional aspects of PDer
---

We want to describe the advantages of developing the theory of derivators initiated by
Grothendieck and developed by Groth, Shulman and others in terms of
2-dimensional category theory. The axioms of derivator become
natural requests on `well-behaved' objects in the larger 2-topos of
prederivators. A few original results stem from this
perspective (most notably, an elegant theory of monads).
