title: Categorical Tools

I started another project (similar to the Jacobians mathematicians) called
**Categorical Tools**, where I tried to propose a bit of categorical
language to the "heathens", and in order to introduce the youngsters here
in math@unipd to the "classical" constructions any functorial gung-ho must
meet at least once in a lifetime (bits of [enriched category theory][ECT],
toposes, [spectral sequences][SS], [homotopy theory][HT], weighted limits,
[coend-juggling][CJ], higher category theory...).
